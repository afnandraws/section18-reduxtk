NEVER mutate directly the Redux state for example: state.counter++

Also, Redux overrides, not update the data, therefore you must return all the elements of the state back, otherwise they will be undefined

Have a look at Section 18 Summary for clarification on React Redux Toolkit and how to split the slices into their own files
